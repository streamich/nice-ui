The *cards* are block components which are usually sized as a square-like card---they
normally consume a half or a third of the full screen width and their contents
is composed of *list item* components.

You import the card components from the `4-card` folder
to reduce the bundle size.

```ts
import {Component, ComponentProps} from 'nice-ui/lib/4-card/Component';
```
