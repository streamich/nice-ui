The *list item* are block components which consume a full row, usually in some
list. The list item components normally have their CSS `display` property
set to `block`.

You import the list item components from the `3-list-item` folder
to reduce the bundle size.

```ts
import {
  Component,
  ComponentProps,
} from 'nice-ui/lib/3-list-item/Component';
```
