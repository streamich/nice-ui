The *inline block* components are similar to the *inline* components, they flow
with the content, but they may take a fixed width and height. The inline
components normally have their CSS `display` property set to `inline-block`.

You import the inline block components from the `2-inline-block` folder
to reduce the bundle size.

```ts
import {
  Component,
  ComponentProps,
} from 'nice-ui/lib/2-inline-block/Component';
```
