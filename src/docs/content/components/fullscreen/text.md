The *fullscreen* components represent components which can span the entire page,
those are usually used for modals.

You import the fullscreen components from the `7-fullscreen` folder
to reduce the bundle size.

```ts
import {
  Component,
  ComponentProps,
} from 'nice-ui/lib/7-fullscreen/Component';
```
