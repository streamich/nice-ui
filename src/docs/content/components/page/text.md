The *page* components represent components which can span the full width and
height of a page (excluding the header, footer, and sidebar).

You import the page components from the `6-page` folder
to reduce the bundle size.

```ts
import {Component, ComponentProps} from 'nice-ui/lib/6-page/Component';
```
