You can use any routing library with Nice UI. However, Nice UI internally uses
`react-router-lite`.

You can install a compatible version of `react-router-lite` in your application.

```bash
npm install react-router-lite
```

Or, import it directly from the Nice UI library.

```jsx
import {Router, Route, Link} from 'nice-ui/lib/misc/router';
```
